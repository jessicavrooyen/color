Light that appears white to us, such as light from the sun, is actually composed of many colors. Each color has its own measurable wavelength or combination of wavelengths.The wavelengths of light are not colored, but produced the sensation of color. Light is a form of energy. All wavelengths of light are part of the electromagnetic energy spectrum. The spectrum is a continuous sequence of energy waves that vary in lengths from short to long. Visible light – the wavelengths our eyes can detect – is a small portion of the entire spectrum. </p>

Each wavelength, or color, bends at a slightly different angle which separates the white light into an array of colors. When the sun comes out after a rainstorm, water droplets in the air can act as prisms and display the arc of colors in the sky we see as a rainbow.</div>
						<div class="col-md-3 para1">The visible portion of the spectrum is divided into Thirds, the predominant colors are blue, green and red. These are primary colors of light. Visible colors can be arranged in a circle, commonly known as the color wheel. Blue, green and red form a triangle on the color wheel. In between the primary colors are the secondary colors, cyan, magenta and yellow which form another triangle.</div>
